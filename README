To compile:
0. Unpack the tar file in a directory of your choice (preferrably
   outside the main PSBLAS directory).
1. run configure --with-psblas=<ABSOLUTE path of the PSBLAS source directory>
   adding the options for SuperLU, SuperLU_Dist, UMFPACK as desired.
2. Tweak Make.inc if you are not satisfied.

3. make; 

4. Go into the test subdirectory and build the examples of your choice.

Notes:
The single precision version is  supported only by SuperLU; thus, even
if you specify at configure to use UMFPACK or SuperLU_Dist, the
corresponding preconditioner options will be available only from the
double precision version.
