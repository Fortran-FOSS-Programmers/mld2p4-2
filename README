To compile:
0. Unpack the tar file in a directory of your choice (preferrably
   outside the main PSBLAS directory).
1. Edit Make.inc and point PSBLASDIR to the main PSBLAS directory;
   this must be an ABSOLUTE pathname
2. Uncomment the variable definition for SLU, SLUDist, UMFPACK as
   desired, and fix the installation directory/library names. Again,
   directories must be ABSOLUTE pathnames.
