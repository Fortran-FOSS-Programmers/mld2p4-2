This directory contains  the PSBLAS library, version 2.0.
The version 1.0 of the library is described in:
S. Filippone, M. Colajanni
PSBLAS: A library for parallel linear algebra computation on sparse matrices
ACM Trans. on Math. Software, 26(4), Dec. 2000, pp. 527-550.

PLATFORMS: 

For the F77 compiler, we assume it supports DOUBLE COMPLEX and DO WHILE/ENDDO.
Practically all compilers do nowadays.  
The compilation process relies on the choice of an appropriate
Make.inc file; we have tested with AIX XLF, Intel ifc/Linux, Lahey
F95/Linux,  Nag f95/Linux, GNU Fortran/Linux. If you succeed in compiling with 
other compiler/operating systems please let us know. 

IBM SP2.
The library has been tested on an IBM SP2 with XLC and XLF
compilers, and a version of the BLACS based on MPI.
The rather baroque setting 
 F90=xlf90 -qsuffix=f=f90
in Make.inc.rs6k takes care of the f90 extension. 
WARNING: xlf 8.1 introduced a performance bug, whereas a Fortan 90
code calling a  Fortan 77 code would incur spurious array copies;
please make sure your system has the PTF xlf 8102 installed. 


LINUX:

There finally exist a GNU Fortran 95 implementation: we are using the
development snapshots from GCC 3.5.0, later 4.1 and 4.2  since July
2004, and it appears  to work. The 4.2 version of GNU compilers is now
our reference platform. 


Vast F90/Linux is  now obsolete, in that we have a NULL()
initialization for pointers that is outside strict F90. 
For the PGI compilers, we used them in conjunction with gcc, NOT
pgcc. Note that with pgi 3.6 we have horrible performance, due to
spurious array copies when calling Fortran 77 codes from Fortran 90;
this is fixed in version 4 and later. 

The Lahey version we got access to (6.0 and 6.1) seems to suffer from
the same extra copies problem; this is most apparent in the matrix
build process.  

For the Intel compilers, we used ifc versions  7, 8 and 9; with version 6.0 
you need to change the way modules are handled, but we recommend to migrate
to the new version anyway. Moreover, with versions prior to 7.1, there
is a strange error in pargen/ppde90: the compiler did not like the
INTERFACE for the dummy argument subroutine PARTS, it wanted an
EXTERNAL specification. Again, please move to 7.1.


Testing of  NAG f95 versions is still incomplete.

Please consult the sample programs, especially TEST/pargen/ppde90.f90. 


OTHER SOFTWARE CREDITS 

We include our modified implementation of some of the Sparker (serial
sparse BLAS)  material,  e.g. Jagged diagonal, plus a number of
extensions of our own design. The original file spblas.f can be
downloaded from matisa.cc.rl.ac.uk; of course any bugs in our
implementation are our own to fix.  The main reference for the serial
sparse BLAS is:

level interface

We have had good results with  the METIS library, which can be

We include interfaces to:
