Changelog. A lot less detailed than usual, at least for past
history. 

2011/01/07: Fixed UMF interfacing for Z data.

2011/01/04: Added UMF inteface for D data.
	
2011/01/02: Fix usage of DESC_DATA. Switched all names to F90 ending. 

2010/12/16: Fix usage of replicated space descriptor.

2010/11/16: Fix Jacobi smoother in case of empty off-diagonal. 	

2010/11/04: Defined and tested single real and complex.

2010/11/02: Aligned usage of sparse data type with psblas3.

2009/12/22: Aligned constants with mld2p4 v1.2

2009/12/11: First working version of double multilevel.

2009/12/05: Inttroduction of Smoother/Solver object hierarchy.

2009/09/23: Initial F2003 version. 	
      
	
2009/01/28: Changed names from XbaseprcY to XbaseprecY.
2009/01/27: Changed names from mld_transfer to mld_move_alloc.
	
2009/01/13: Repackaged the one-level preconditioners. Reorganized the
            build routines, taking out mlprec_bld, and switching the
	    number of levels when needed. 
2008/10/27: Changed the definition of prec_type: repackaged with a
	    onelev-prec-type, containing a baseprec and maps between
	    index spaces. No performance impact; no changes to
	    user-level interfaces.
	
2008/09/18: Changed mld_sizeof to integer(8); updated samples.	
	
2008/08/26: Fixed matrix generation in sample programs. 
	
2008/07/25: missing implicit none in mld_prec_type.	
	
2008/07/23: added HTML documentation  
	
2008/06/13: Fixed aggregation for replicated index spaces.

2008/06/02: Threshold into decoupled aggregation algorithm.
	
2008/05/27: Single precision version.

2008/03/09: Introduced configure script. 
	
2008/02/08: Merged changes from intermesh branch: we now have an
	    inter_desc_type object. Cleaned up data allocation and
	    variable initialization in multilevel prec application.

2008/01/10: Merged various fixes for: prologues, unused variables,
	    interface details.	
2007/12/21: Merge version with prologues and internal docs.
	
2007/11/15: Created pargen example.	

2007/11/14: Fix INTENT(IN) on X vector in preconditioner routines.

2007/10/19: Merged in ILU(P,T). To be tested extensively.

2007/10/17: Merged ILU(K) into trunk.

2007/10/16: Fixed ILU(K), it now performs satisfactorily. Also updated
	    ILU(0) to be more legible. 
	
2007/10/11: First working version of ILU(K). Still slow, there should
	    be room for improvement. 
	
2007/10/09: Added benchmark code.

2007/10/09: Added MILU_N_. Beware: values for UMF_ etc. have been
	    shifted. 

2007/10/02: To do: decide whether to name MLD_KRYLOV_MOD or
	    PSB_KRYLOV_MOD. 

2007/10/01: Start of this changelog. MLD2P4 now has a different
	    structure, to enable a build not embedded in PSBLAS.
