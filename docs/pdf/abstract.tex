\emph{MLD2P4 (Multi-Level Domain Decomposition Parallel Preconditioners Package based on
PSBLAS}) is a package of parallel algebraic multi-level preconditioners.
It implements various versions of one-level additive and of multi-level additive
and hybrid Schwarz algorithms. In the multi-level case, a purely algebraic approach
is applied to generate coarse-level corrections, so that no geometric background is needed
concerning the matrix to be preconditioned. The matrix is required to be square, real or complex, with a symmetric sparsity pattern \textbf{Non consideriamo anche il caso non simmetrico
con $(A+A^T)/2$?}.

MLD2P4 has been designed to provide scalable and easy-to-use preconditioners in the
context of the PSBLAS (Parallel Sparse Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms)
computational framework and can be used in conjuction with the Krylov solvers
available in this framework. MLD2P4 enables the user to easily specify different aspects
of a generic algebraic multilevel Schwarz preconditioner, thus allowing to search
for the ``best'' preconditioner for the problem at hand. The package has been designed 
employing object-oriented techniques, using Fortran 95 and MPI, with interfaces to
additional external libraries such as UMFPACK, SuperLU and SuperLU\_Dist, that
can be exploited in building multi-level preconditioners.
